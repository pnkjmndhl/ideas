*ABC Matrix*
************

Description:
	This python program randomly generates 2 matrices of sizes (M*N) and (N*O). It then calculates the product of those matrices.

Source files:
    ABCMatrix.py
 
Run:
    python ABCMatrix.py

Inputs:
    The program takes the rows and columns of the first matrix and the column of the second matrix.

Outputs:
    The output of the program is the product of the two randomly generated matrices.
	

**************
*RandomXYZ*
**************

Description:
	This program generates uniformly distributed X, Y and Z coordinates. These co-ordinates are independently generated for each axis. The program then displays the average distance between all these coordinates.

Source files:
    randomxyz.py

Run:
    python randomxyz.py

Inputs:
	The input is the number of points to generate.
	
Outputs:
	The output is the co-ordinates of all the points generated and the average distance between them.
